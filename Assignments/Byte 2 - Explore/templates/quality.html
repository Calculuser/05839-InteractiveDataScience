	<h1>Quality: About This Data Set</h1>
        <p>Since the data is collected by U.S. Census Bureau and imported by Google, the quality should be high and the integrity can be trusted. However, I think there are still some disadvantages in this dataset, which can be improved.</a></p>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data complete?</h2>
	<p>I think the data is complete.</p>
	<p>Firstly, there is no missing part in this table and no data is not exist.</p>
	<p>Secondly, there is no reporting errors. No duplicate data is included and it includes houses with various sizes and ages in Pennsylvania.</p>
	<p>Lastly, it matches my question. I would like to study household heating methods as stated in Project Byte 1. This dataset is just what I want.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data coherent?</h2>
	<p>The data is coherent. Each entry in the "State" column only contains two uppercase characters "PA". Other values are all real numbers and smaller than 100 because they represent percents. Thus, data is coherent.</p>
	<p>Note that portions from the three methods do not necessarily add up to 100 because some houses may not have heating methods or they may use other methods, which are not shown in the table.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="page-header">
	<h2>Is the data correct?</h2>
	<p>Well, it is hard to verify the correctness because names of all cities are hiden by labels. However, there is a strong reason for me to believe the data is correct. The survey is conducted by U.S. Census Bureau and imported by Google.
	They both have high reputations, so I believe the data are correct. However, I think the data may exists bias since there are only 19 records. Of course, Pennsylvania has more than 19 cities, which means there are some cities or areas are
	not included in the table. Thus, I think there may exist some bias.</p>
